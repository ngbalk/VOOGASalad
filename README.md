####Files used for testing: 
Data files made by the Game Authoring Environment


####Data required by project:
Authoring environment and playing environment will save/load files located in the same folder. Properly formatted files are created when saving from the authoring part, and games cannot be loaded unless files with this format are loaded in the player.


####Information about using the program:
PSTGameAuthor is used to launch the authoring environment, and PSTGamePlayer is used to launch the game playing environment. Saving in the authoring environment is saved to a default location, and objects in the player can be loaded from any location. Gameplay is begun by pressing play, and can be paused by pressing the pause button.
 
####Known Problems:
Playing environment cannot handle more than one Hero character due to one of our design decisions.
 
####Extra Features:
Our Authoring GUI has the ability has the ability to switch the location of panes based on user input/preferences. Additionally, our utility allows sharing of our game through texting via Twilio. Finally, our design allows for the creation and playing of games not traditionally viewed as platformer games, such as Frogger or Legend of Zelda-type games.
